> Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database would be used when changes to the data need to last beyond the program or be accessible by multiple users or instances of the program simultaneously. A text file is fine if the data can be locked without causing use-errors.  

> Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is declarative, which means you only request information instead of coding how to retrieve information. The SQL language must be used "as-is" and can't be built on in the same way as you can build functions with some other languages.

> In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

At a high level, a database is a collection of organized information. SQL databases mirror the table format with rows and columns where a value is stored in a cell that is a given intersection of a row and column.  
> Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

From smallest to largest, a value is a stored piece of data. A cell is the intersection of a row and column that holds a value. A row is a horizontal line of cells. A column is a vertical line of cells. A table is a collection of rows and columns. 

> List three data types that can be used in a table.

Float, String, Integer.


> Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:
  SELECT date, amount
  FROM payments;

  This would return:
  ('2016-05-01', 1500.00),
  ('2016-05-10', 37.00),
  ('2016-05-15', 124.93),
  ('2016-05-23', 54.72);

> SELECT amount
  FROM payments
  WHERE amount > 500;  
  
  This would return:

  (37.00),
  (124.93),
  (54.72);
  
> SELECT *
  FROM payments
  WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

  ('2016-05-15', 'Mega Foods', 124.93, 'Groceries')

> Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:

  FROM users
  WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'
 
  All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.
